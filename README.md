The auto-correct tool is engineered to enhance text correction efficiency, and the chosen algorithm for its functionality is based on statistical language models with a focus on common grammatical errors.
This report outlines the reasoning behind opting for this algorithm, its advantages, and acknowledges potential challenges.

Text Correction Approach:
The auto-correct tool operates by analyzing input text and suggesting corrections based on predefined patterns and statistical probabilities of language usage. 
It employs a model that understands typical grammatical structures, contextual relationships, and common errors made by users.
